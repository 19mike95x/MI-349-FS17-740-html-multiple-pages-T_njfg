    <h1>Terran</h1>
    <p>Tempered by hardship and strife, the resourceful terrans have proven a formidable match even for the technologically advanced protoss or the ravenous zerg.</p>
    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <h3>Survivors</h3>
    <p>The terrans have learned to adapt their tactics to rapidly changing battlefield conditions in surprising ways. Terran production facilities,
      for example, can lift off and fly to different locations, allowing the terrans to relocate entire bases on the fly.</p>
    <h3>Build Anywhere</h3>
    <p>Unlike the other races, terrans can create buildings wherever they want. Combined with their production facilitiesâ€™
      lift-off capabilities, terrans have incredible base-building flexibility.</p>
    <h3>Adaptable</h3>
    <p>The terran military includes highly trained and specialized infantry units such as the rugged and reliable Marines,
      guerrilla-fighting reapers, and the stealthy ghost infiltrators. Mixing different units allows the terrans to capably handle any situation.</p>
