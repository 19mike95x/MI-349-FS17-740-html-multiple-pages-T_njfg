    <h1>Zerg</h1>
    <p>Led by the cunning Queen of Blades, the zerg are set to unleash their alien horrors on the galaxy, threatening to consume all who stand in their way.</p>
    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <h3>Strength in Numbers</h3>
    <p>Left unchecked, the zerg multiply at an alarming rate and spawn large armies quickly. Individual zerg units may not be
      as strong or as hardy as the other races’ forces, but that doesn’t matter when you’re facing an endless stream of them.</p>
    <h3>Creep</h3>
    <p>Zerg bases spread creep, a biological substance that nourishes and sustains the Swarm’s colonies. Creep nourishes zerg units and provides them with a movement speed bonus.</p>
    <h3>Burrow</h3>
    <p>All zerg ground units can gain the ability to burrow underground. Burrowed units lurk unseen, anticipating the right moment
      to strike. Some zerg units can even move underground while burrowed.</p>
